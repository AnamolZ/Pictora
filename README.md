A structured approach to developing a fully self-supervised image captioning model using 10,000 images with limited resources. Without human-provided captions for training, the method leverages pre-trained models for auxiliary tasks while generating self-supervised pseudo-captions. Each step is detailed to ensure a systematic and effective implementation.

---

### **Step One: Environment Configuration**
Organize the 10,000 images systematically in data/images/ directory structure.

---

### **Step Two: Data Preparation and Preprocessing**
Prepare your dataset for processing. Since we have 10,000 images and cannot use their captions during training, focus on the images alone. Inspect the images to ensure they are in a consistent format (e.g., JPG), and resize them if necessary to a manageable resolution (e.g., 640x480) to balance quality and resource usage—use a batch resizing tool like ImageMagick if manual resizing is impractical. Next, leverage your existing processed files: `coco_labels.json` for object categories (derived from COCO) and `vg_relationships.json` for relationship predicates (from Visual Genome). These files provide a foundation for object detection and relationship prediction. Additionally, use `categories_places365.txt` for scene classification, which lists 365 scene categories. Create an output directory (e.g., `processed_json/structured_data/`) to store intermediate results. This step ensures your data is structured and accessible, setting the stage for extracting self-supervised signals.

### **Step Three: Extracting Structured Information from Images**
The core of the self-supervised approach begins here: extracting detailed information from each image without human labels. Use pre-trained models for three key tasks—object detection, scene classification, and relationship prediction—to build a structured representation of each image. For object detection, employ Faster R-CNN with a ResNet50 backbone from Torchvision, pre-trained on COCO, to identify objects (e.g., "person," "horse") using your `coco_labels.json` to map detected IDs to names. Set a confidence threshold (e.g., 0.5) to filter low-confidence detections, ensuring accuracy. For scene classification, use a ResNet50 model pre-trained on Places365 (download weights from the official Places365 repository), aligning its 365 output classes with `categories_places365.txt` to determine the scene (e.g., "beach," "forest"). For relationship prediction, use CLIP from Hugging Face to score candidate relationships (e.g., "person riding horse") generated from object pairs and predicates in `vg_relationships.json`; limit candidates (e.g., top 10 predicates) to manage resource usage. Process each image sequentially or in batches, combining the outputs into a JSON structure per image (e.g., scene, objects, relationships), and save these files in your output directory. This step generates rich, self-supervised data critical for the next phase.

### **Step Four: Generating Pseudo-Captions**
Now, transform the structured data into natural language pseudo-captions to serve as training targets. Use a pre-trained language model like GPT-2 (from Hugging Face), which is trained on text generation—not captioning—making it permissible under your constraints. For each image’s JSON file, construct a prompt that summarizes its structured data (e.g., “Describe a beach scene with a person riding a horse and a dog nearby”). Feed this prompt to GPT-2, configuring it with a low temperature (e.g., 0.7) for coherence and a maximum length (e.g., 50 tokens) for detailed yet concise outputs. Generate one pseudo-caption per image, such as “A person is riding a horse on the beach while a dog stands nearby.” To optimize for limited resources, process images in batches or precompute captions offline if memory is a concern. Save these pseudo-captions alongside their corresponding images (e.g., in a new directory like `processed_json/pseudo_captions/` or as a paired list), ensuring they are easily accessible for training. This step bridges the gap between structured data and human-like descriptions, maintaining the self-supervised nature of the project.

### **Step Fifth: Designing and Training the Custom Captioning Model**
With pseudo-captions ready, design a custom image captioning model to learn from these self-generated labels. Adopt an encoder-decoder architecture: use a CNN like MobileNetV3 (from Torchvision) as the encoder to extract image features, chosen for its efficiency on limited resources, and a Transformer or LSTM as the decoder to generate text, balancing accuracy and computational cost. Initialize the encoder with pre-trained weights (e.g., ImageNet) to leverage transfer learning, but train the decoder from scratch to avoid relying on pre-trained captioning models. Pair each image with its pseudo-caption, preprocess images (e.g., resize to 224x224, normalize), and tokenize captions using a standard tokenizer (e.g., from Hugging Face’s tokenizers). Train the model using a cross-entropy loss function, optimizing with Adam and a learning rate of around 0.001, and apply techniques like early stopping and learning rate scheduling to prevent overfitting on your 10,000-image dataset. Use data augmentation (e.g., random crops, flips) to enhance generalization. Train on batches (e.g., size 16 or 32, depending on resources) for several epochs (e.g., 20-50), monitoring loss to ensure convergence. Save the trained model weights for later use.

### **Step Sixth: Evaluating Model Performance**
Evaluate the model’s accuracy and descriptiveness using permitted methods. If allowed, use your image-text caption pairs strictly for evaluation (not training) to compute standard metrics like BLEU, CIDEr, and METEOR, comparing generated captions to ground-truth captions. This provides a quantitative measure of performance, though it’s optional given the self-supervised constraint. For a fully self-supervised evaluation, use CLIP to score the alignment between each image and its generated caption, calculating a similarity score (e.g., cosine similarity) to assess how well the caption describes the image. Set a target threshold (e.g., 0.8) for acceptable alignment, and analyze a sample of outputs manually to verify descriptiveness. If performance is suboptimal, identify failure cases (e.g., inaccurate relationships) and prepare for refinement. This step ensures your model meets the project’s high-accuracy goal while adhering to constraints.

---

### **Step Seventh: Iterative Refinement and Optimization**
Refine the model iteratively to maximize accuracy. Start by analyzing evaluation results: if CLIP scores are low, revisit the pseudo-caption generation—adjust GPT-2 prompts or expand relationship candidates in Step 3 using more predicates from `vg_relationships.json`. If object detection misses key elements, increase the confidence threshold or switch to a higher-capacity model like Faster R-CNN with ResNet101, balancing resource limits. Retrain the captioning model with updated pseudo-captions, using techniques like curriculum learning (start with simpler images) or fine-tuning the encoder slightly. To optimize for limited resources, distill the model into a smaller version (e.g., using knowledge distillation with a lighter decoder), ensuring it runs efficiently without sacrificing too much accuracy. Repeat evaluation after each iteration, aiming for incremental improvements until performance plateaus or meets your target. Save the final optimized model weights.

---

### **Step Eight: Final Execution and Deployment**
Once satisfied with the model’s performance, prepare it for final execution. Test it end-to-end on a subset of images (e.g., 100) to simulate real-world usage, generating captions and verifying outputs for correctness and detail. Finally, process all 10,000 images to generate captions, saving them in a structured format (e.g., a CSV or JSON file), and validate a random sample to confirm consistency. This step completes the project, delivering a fully self-supervised, high-accuracy captioning system.
